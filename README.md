#photo-chaosmaker 
a script-fu for The Gimp that generates funny desktop wallpapers. It takes in input a directory of pictures, extracts N of them, generates nice polaroid frames along with a description (using the filename), then scatters them chaotically on a given surface image (a table, a floor, blackscreen...).

A word of warning: this script was written back in 2006, before Gimp adopted TinyScheme for its script-fu. Some features may be deprecated and need updates.
